        <h2> Biography </h2>
        <p>I am a student at California Polytechnic State University. I am studying Economics concentrating in Quantitative Analysis with minors in Statistics and Environmental Studies. I love to kiteboard, surf, ski, rock-climb and cook. I am hoping to eventually earn my PhD but we will see if I have what it takes.</p>
        <h2> Education </h2>
        <p>I attended Park City High School where I was an honor roll student and graduated with above a 4.0 gpa among the top 10% of my class. I have held numerous leadership positions including; captain of my lacrosse team, board member for Teen Council which is a division of Planned Parenthood, board member for Cal Poly Economics Society with title "Vice President of External Affairs."</p>
        <h2> Research </h2>
        <p> I have worked and continue to work on a few reserach projects with an emphasis on econometric and statistical techniques. To date, I have completed projects surrounding Public Transportation as well as Poverty Rates by county. In the summer of 2019 I will be taking on my most profound and informative research project to date. I will be researching with Dr. Anurag Pande, a professor in the Civil Engineering department at Cal Poly. I was recruited into a group of entirely engineers as a liason between the other assistants and our PI to explain and develop the data analytics portion of the paper. The program, titled SURP is generally only open to engineering students and faculty. I sufficiently demonstrated my knowledge of mathematics, physics, and most importantly statistics and was able to earn a spot among the ranks. </p>
